## Background and Overview

Current.js is an endless 2D scroller game that gradually scales its difficulty to match the skill of the player. The game is designed to be easy to pick up for beginners with its simple controls, and hard to put down for experienced players who seek a challenge. You play as an eel swimming down a current, maneuvering to eat smaller prey and to avoid larger predators. After eating a certain amount of prey, you will gain the ability to activate your electrical current. This property makes you invunerable to predators for a limited amount of time. This will come in handy, because the longer you play, the faster the current becomes!

## Architecture and Technologies
Current.js is built with vanilla JavaScript to handle processing of game logic, and HTML5 canvas to handle rendering of game objects. Webpack is used to bundle and serve up various scripts.
